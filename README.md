## Existential Comics Scraper

This is a script that scrapes the [Existential Comics](https://existentialcomics.com/) webcomic and downloads every page of it. It keeps track of pages that have multiple images and groups them together.

It is persistent, and will remember where it left off so you can continuously update your downloaded copy of the comic. It also has a basic error catcher that will save progress in the comic in-case something goes wrong.

I've done a complete run through and it worked with no real errors (as of May 15th.) There is one known error, marked below.

## A note 

If you're here you really like webcomics and like being a philosophy nerd. If that's true, and you have extra income, try supporting the webcomic either by directly buying their [merch](https://www.teepublic.com/stores/existentialcomics?utm_campaign=1499&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=ExistentialComics) or by contributing to their [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ExistentialComics).  Webcomics are a precarious business in any time, but now more than ever. Also, anybody that can rile up Elon Musk as much as Corey Mohler does is almost, by definition, a good person. 

## Future Plans + Known Bugs

I'm not sure I would plan to update this anymore? It does what it does. 

There is one known bug where sometimes the first error catch when it's accessing a page of the web-comic won't work. This is annoying, but I haven't been able to find a way to regularly replicate the bug. If you find issues please let me know and I may try and resolve them.
